				<b>The IBM 702:</b> a computer used by the first <strong>generation
					of AI researchers</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>In the 1940s and 50s</b>, a handful of scientists from a variety
				of fields<mark>mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and
				political science</mark>began to discuss the possibility of<em> creating 
				an artificial brain</em>. The field of
				<mark>artificial intelligence research</mark>
				was founded as<em> an academic discipline in </em>. The
				<mark>history of artificial intelligence (AI)</mark>
				began in antiquity, with <b>myths</b>, stories and rumors of
				artificial beings endowed with
				<ins>intelligence</ins>
				or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were
				<del>Planted</del>
				planted by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of
				human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work
				culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in
				the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical
				reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it
				<del>inspired</del>
				inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the
				possibility of building an electronic brain.The field of AI research
				was founded at a workshop held on the campus of <b>Dartmouth
				College</b>, USA during the summer of <i>1956</i>.Those who attended
				would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them
				predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist
				in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of
				dollars to make this vision come true.Eventually, it became obvious
				that commercial developers and researchers had grossly
				underestimated the difficulty of the project.<b> In 1974</b>,in
				response to the criticism from <b>James Lighthill</b> and ongoing
				pressure from congress, the U.S. and
				<mark>British Governments</mark>
				stopped funding undirected research into <b>artificial
				intelligence</b>, and the difficult years that followed would later be
				known as an
				<mark>"AI winter"</mark>
				.<b>Seven years later</b>, a visionary initiative by the <i>Japanese
				Government inspired governments</i> and industry to provide AI with
				billions of dollars but by the <b>late 80s</b> the investors became
				disillusioned and withdrew funding again.Investment and interest in
				<mark>AI boomed in the first decades of the 21st century</mark>
				when machine learning was successfully applied to many problems in
				academia and industry due to new methods, the application of
				powerful computer hardware, and the collection of immense data sets.

					<b>In Greek Mythology,Talos</b> was a giant constructed of bronze
					who acted as guardian for the
					<mark>island of Crete</mark>
					.He would throw boulders at the <em>ships of invaders, and
					would complete 3 circuits around the island's perimeter daily</em>.According
					to <b>pseudo-Apollodorus' Bibliotheke, Hephaestus forged Talos</b>
					with the aid of a
					<mark>cyclops and presented the automaton as a gift to Minos</mark>
					.In the<b> Argonautica, Jason and the Argonauts</b> defeated him by
					way of a single plug near his foot which, once removed, allowed the
					vital ichor to flow out from his body and left him
					inanimate.Pygmalion was a legendary king and sculptor of Greek
					Mythology, famously represented in Ovid’s Metamorphoses. In the
					10th book of Ovid’s narrative poem, Pygmalion becomes disgusted
					with women when he witnesses the way in which the Propoetides
					prostitute themselves.Despite this, he makes offerings at the
					temple of Venus asking the goddess to bring to him a woman just
					like a statue he carved. The earliest written account regarding
					golem-making is found in the writings of Eleazar ben Judah of Worms
					circa 12-13th C.During the Middle Ages, it was believed that the
					animation of a Golem could be achieved by insertion of a piece of
					paper with any of God’s names on it, into the mouth of the clay
					figure. Unlike legendary automata like Brazen Heads,a Golem was
					unable to speak.

					In Of the Nature of Things, written by the
					<mark>Swiss-born alchemist, Paracelsus</mark>
					,he describes a procedure which he claims can fabricate an <b>"artificial
					man"</b>. By placing the <b>"sperm of a man"</b> in horse dung, and
					feeding it the <b>"Arcanum of Mans blood"</b> after 40 days, the
					concoction will become a living infant.<b> Takwin</b>, the
					artificial
					<mark>creation of life</mark>
					was a frequent topic of <b>Ismaili alchemical manuscripts</b>,
					especially those attributed to <b>Jabir ibn Hayyan</b>. <b>Islamic
					alchemists</b> attempted to create a broad range of life through their
					work, ranging from plants to animals.<b>In Faust</b>, The Second
					Part of the <strong>Tragedy by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</strong>,
					an alchemically fabricated Homunculus, destined to live forever in
					the flask in which he was made,endeavors to be born into a full
					human body.<b>Ali Rahimi</b>, a researcher in artificial
					intelligence AI at Google in San Francisco, California, took a
					swipe at his field last December—and received a 40-second ovation
					for it. Speaking at an AI conference, Rahimi charged that machine
					learning algorithms, in which computers learn through trial and
					error, have become a form of alchemy. Researchers, he said, do not
					know why some algorithms work and others don't, nor do they have
					rigorous criteria for choosing one AI architecture over another.
					Now, in a paper presented on 30 April at the International
					Conference on Learning Representations in Vancouver, Canada, Rahimi
					and his collaborators document examples of what they see as the
					alchemy problem and offer prescriptions for bolstering AI's rigor.
					There's an anguish in the field, Rahimi says. Many of us feel like
					we're operating on an alien technology. The issue is distinct from
					AI's reproducibility problem (Science, 16 February, p. 725), in
					which researchers can't replicate each other's results because of
					inconsistent experimental and publication practices. It also
					differs from the
					<mark>black box</mark>
					or interpretability problem in machine learning: the difficulty of
					explaining how a particular AI has come to its conclusions <i>Science,
					7 July 2017, p. 22</i>. As Rahimi puts it, I'm trying to draw a
					distinction between a machine learning system that's a black box
					and an entire field that's become a black box.

					<b>Realistic humanoid automata</b> were built by
					<mark>craftsman</mark>
					from every civilization, <i>including Yan Shi</i>,<Strong>
					Hero of Alexandria, Al-Jazari, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, and Wolfgang
					von Kempelen</Strong>.The <b>oldest known automata</b> were the <em>sacred
					statues of ancient Egypt and Greece</em>.Functional materials are
					commonly employed in emerging technologies, such as green energy
					solutions and new electronic devices. These materials are typically
					blends of different organic and inorganic components and have many
					advantageous properties for novel applications. To achieve their
					full potential, we need precise knowledge on their atomic
					structure. State-of-the-art experimental tools, such as atomic
					force microscopy (AFM), can be used to investigate organic
					molecular adsorbates on metallic surfaces.However, interpreting the
					actual structure from microscopy images is often difficult.
					Computational simulations can help to estimate the most probable
					structures, but with complex materials, accurate structure search
					is computationally intractable with conventional methods. Recently,
					the CEST group has developed new tools for automated structure
					prediction using machine-learning algorithms from computer science.
					In this most recent work, researchers have demonstrated the
					accuracy and efficiency of the Bayesian Optimization Structure
					Search (BOSS) artificial intelligence method. BOSS identified the
					adsorbate configurations of a camphor molecule on a Cu(111)
					surface. This material has been previously studied with AFM, but
					inferring the structures from those images was inconclusive. Here,
					the researchers have shown that BOSS can successfully identify not
					only the most probable structure, but also eight stable adsorbate
					configurations that camphor can have on Cu(111). They used these
					model structures to better interpret the AFM experiments and
					concluded that the images likely feature camphor chemically bound
					to the Cu surface via an oxygen atom. Analyzing single molecular
					adsorbates in this way is only the first step toward studying more
					complex assemblies of several molecules on surfaces and
					subsequently the formation of monolayers. The acquired insight on
					interface structures could help to optimize the functional
					properties of these materials.

					<b>Artificial intelligence</b> is based on the assumption that the
					process of human thought can be mechanized. The
					<mark>study of mechanical—or "formal"—reasoning</mark>
					has a long history. <b>Chinese, Indian and Greek philosophers</b>
					all
					<ins>developed</ins>
					structured methods of formal deduction in the first
					<mark>millennium BCE</mark>
					.Their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such
					as <i>Aristotle </i>who gave a formal <em>analysis of the
					syllogism</em>,<b> Euclid </b> whose Elements was a model of formal
					reasoning,<b>al-Khwarizml</b> who developed
					<mark>algebra and gave his name to "algorithm"</mark>
					and European scholastic
					<ins>philosophers</ins>
					such as <em>William of Ockham and Duns Scotus</em>.Knowledge
					Representation and Reasoning plays a central role in Artificial
					Intelligence. It is one of the oldest areas of AI, as from early on
					researchers realised that knowledge and reasoning are two of the
					key components of intelligent behavior. The Special Interest Group
					is concerned with the representation of knowledge and the
					formalisation of reasoning.This covers a wide range of topics, from
					the modeling of reasoning in specific domains think diagnosis or
					law to software for automated theorem proving, and from the
					development of knowledge databases to the study of human reasoning
					as displayed in specific reasoning tasks.The following four areas
					are represented in the SIG, but activities in any other areas
					within or related to Knowledge Representation and Reasoning are

					intelligence includes several key areas where our faculty are
					recognized leaders: computer vision, machine listening, natural
					language processing, machine learning and robotics. Computer vision
					systems can understand images and video, for example, building
					extensive geometric and physical models of cities from video, or
					warning construction workers about nearby dangers. Natural language
					processing systems understand written and spoken language;
					possibilities include automatic translation of text from one
					language to another, or understanding text on Wikipedia to produce
					knowledge about the world. Machine listening systems understand
					audio signals, with applications like speech recognition, acoustic
					monitoring, or transcribing polyphonic music automatically. Crucial
					to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning methods exploit
					examples in order to adjust systems to work as effectively as
					possible. Robotics puts artificial intelligence into practice using

					<b>In the 1940s and 50s</b>, a handful of <i>scientists</i> from a
					variety of fields <em>mathematics, psychology, engineering,
					economics and political science</em> began to discuss the possibility
					of creating an
					<mark>artificial brain</mark>
					.<em>The field of artificial intelligence research </em>was
					founded as an academic discipline in 1956.The birth of artificial
					intelligence was seen with the initial development of neural
					networks including Frank Rosenblatt’s creation of the perceptron
					model and the first demonstration of supervised learning. That led
					to the Georgetown-IBM experiment, an early language translation
					system. Finally, the end of the beginning was marked by the
					Dartmouth Conference, at which artificial intelligence was
					officially launched as a field in computer science, leading to the
					first government funding of AI. NEURAL NETWORKS In 1943, Warren S.
					McCulloch, a neurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a mathematical
					prodigy, created the concept of artificial neural networks. They
					designed their system based on how our brains work and patterned it
					after the biological model of how neurons—brain cells—work with
					each other. Neurons interact with their extremities, firing signals
					via their axon across a synapse to neighboring neurons’ dendrites.
					Depending on the voltage of this electrical charge, the receiving
					neuron proceeds to either fire a new charge of electrical pulse to
					the next set of neurons, or not.
